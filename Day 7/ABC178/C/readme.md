# Problem Statement
How many integer sequences A<sub>1</sub>,A<sub>2</sub>,…,A<sub>N</sub> of length N satisfy all of the following conditions?
* 0 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤ 9
* There exists some i such that A<sub>i</sub>=0 holds.
* There exists some i such that A<sub>i</sub>=9 holds.
The answer can be very large, so output it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.
# Constraints
* 1≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>
* N is an integer.
# Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
```
